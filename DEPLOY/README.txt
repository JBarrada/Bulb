BULB is developed by Justin Barrada.

It is HIGHLY recommended that you run this with a reasonably powerful GPU, raytracing is very computationally expensive.

It is also recommended that you "play" with an XBox controller, keyboard works too but this was intended to be "played" with an XBox controller. The controls aren’t optimized for keyboard.

"Play" is in quotations because this isn’t really a game, it is more of a sandbox and a good way to turn your GPU into a space heater during those chilly winter months.

[Points of Interest]
You can load one of a few different "Fractals". These contain the core mathematics for the structure of the object. They each have their own settings that can be manipulated and animated. The default fractal is the "Cross Menger"
You can load and save "Saves" which contain the "Fractal" and any settings that were manipulated or animated. Think of these as a kind of save state. These files are saved as .BMP files.
The "Shader Settings" menu is where you can tweak and animate almost any setting, fog, detail, colors, and geometrics properties. Keep an eye out for the help tips in the top left of the screen to guide you along.


PLEASE keep in mind, this was made by one person in their off time. This is still technically a work in progress and will have bugs and maybe even crash. That said, if you do find any bugs or have any updates you would like to see, please let me know!
